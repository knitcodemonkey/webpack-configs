# Webpack-Configs.com

Webpack-configs.com was created for my talk series on optimizing and improving webpack builds. I wanted to share the knowledge I've garnered by sharing webpack config file examples.

## Suggest a Webpack Build

If you have a webpack build you would like me to attempt, please create an issue with as many details as possible, including:

* source file structure
* desired dist file structure
* CSS preferences
* Javascript framework preferences (React, Vue, etc.)
* Any other trickery you'd like me to try adding

## Thank you!
